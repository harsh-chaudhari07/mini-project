            Namo Drone Didi is a central sector scheme aiming to empower women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) by equipping them with drone technology to provide agricultural services. The scheme aims to provide drones to 15000 selected Women SHGs during the period from 2024-25 to 2025-2026 for providing rental services to farmers for agriculture purpose (application of liquid fertilizers and pesticides for the present). This initiative is expected to generate an additional income of at least Rs. 1 lakh per year for each SHG, contributing to economic empowerment and sustainable livelihood generation.
