    The Ministry of Heavy Industry, Govt. of India, with the approval of Union Cabinet, chaired by Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narender Modi has launched scheme titled PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) Scheme vide Gazette notification S.O. 4259 (E) on September 29, 2024. The scheme will be implemented from 1st October, 2024 till 31st March, 2026. Further, EMPS-2024, the number of vehicles and the expenditure under EMPS-2024 for e-2w and e-3w being implemented for the period from 1st April 2024 to 30th September 2024 is being subsumed under PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) Scheme, therefore, effective period for the scheme will be two years.
<br>

<p>
    <ul style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; margin-left: 10%; line-height: 1.5;" >
        <li> <strong>Subsidies:</strong> Demand Incentives for e-2W, e-3W, e-ambulances, e-trucks and other new emerging EV categories</li>
        <li> <strong>Grants for creation of capital assets:</strong> e-buses, establishment of network of charging stations & upgradation of testing agencies of MHI, and</li>
        <li><strong>Administration of the Scheme including IEC </strong>(Information, Education & Communication) activities and fee for project management agency (PMA).
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
   <div class="vehicle">
    <p>The following categories of vehicles will be eligible for support:</p> </div>
    <ul style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10%;">
        <li>Buses (only electric buses) (e-bus);</li>
        <li>Three-Wheelers (electric) including registered e-rickshaws & e-carts and L5 (e-3W);
        </li>
     <li>Two wheelers (electric) â€“ e-2W;
    </li>
<li>e-ambulances (electric, plug in hybrid & strong hybrid); and
</li>
<li>e-trucks and other new emerging EV categories (to be notified subsequently).
</li>
    </ul>
<div class="vehicle">
    <p>
        With greater emphasis on providing affordable and environment friendly public transportation options for the masses, scheme will be applicable mainly to vehicles used for public transport or those registered for commercial purposes in e-3W, e-trucks and other new emerging EV categories. However, in addition to commercial use, privately or corporate owned registered e-2W will also be eligible under the scheme. Eligible beneficiaries for e-ambulances shall be decided in consultation with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). Further, where EVs are being purchased from eligible OEMs by any department of the Central or State Government or its agencies, PM E-DRIVE demand incentive shall not be extended, as it amounts to passing of funds from one government head to another.
<br>
The PM E-DRIVE Scheme aims to accelerate EV adoption and establish essential charging infrastructure across the country, promoting cleaner and more sustainable transportation.
